# Deploying on Debian

For simple one server deployments and tests, we have a deploy script available 
you can run on a fresh Debian 11 or Ubuntu 22.04 installation. It will 
configure all components and will be ready for use after running!

Additional scripts are available after deployment:

* Use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for automatic web server 
  certificate management;

## Requirements

* Clean Debian 11, or Ubuntu 22.04 installation with all updates installed and
  rebooted after updates;
* Have a **STATIC** IPv4 and IPv6 address configured on your external 
  interface;
* Network equipment/VM platform allows access to the very least `tcp/80`, 
  `tcp/443`, `udp/1194`, `tcp/1194` and `udp/51820` for basic functionality, 
  the deploy script will take care of the host firewall;
* Working DNS entry for your VPN server, e.g. `vpn.example.org`.
* Have the correct hostname configured on your system. Use 
  `hostnamectl set-hostname vpn.example.org` (as root) to set your hostname. If 
  you need to change the hostname, reboot after to make sure it "sticks".

If you have a more complicated setup, we recommend to manually walk through 
the deploy script and follow the steps.

**NOTE**: we only test with relatively clean and unmodified installations of 
Debian/Ubuntu. If you, or your organization (heavily) modified the OS 
installation the VPN deployment MAY not work...

**NOTE** if you expect to do a production deploy, please read the section below 
about modifying the PHP configuration.

## Base Deploy

Perform these steps on the host where you want to deploy:

    $ sudo apt -y install ca-certificates wget
    $ wget https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/archive/v3.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzf v3.tar.gz
    $ cd documentation-3

We assume you have `sudo` installed and configured for your user first, after
this:

    $ sudo -s
    # ./deploy_debian.sh

**NOTE**: if the script does NOT suggest the actual hostname you want to use 
on your system, make sure you configure your hostname first, see above.

**NOTE**: you can NOT use `localhost` as a hostname, nor an IP address!

**NOTE**: by default there is **NO** firewall for the traffic between VPN 
client and VPN server. So if you have SSH running on your server, the clients
will be able to connect to it when you don't take additional steps! Look 
[here](FIREWALL.md).

**NOTE**: if you want to use the [Development Repository](DEVELOPMENT_REPO.md) 
for your installation, which has development releases and supports additional 
OSes/architectures, use:

```bash
# USE_DEV_REPO=y ./deploy_debian.sh
```

## Update

During the deployment you are asked whether to enable automatic updates. If you
choose `y`, the default, a _cronjob_ is installed in 
`/etc/cron.weekly/vpn-maint-update-system`.

For manual installation, see [INSTALL_UPDATES](INSTALL_UPDATES.md).

## Configuration

### VPN

See [PROFILE_CONFIG](PROFILE_CONFIG.md) on how to update the VPN server 
settings.

### Authentication 

#### Username & Password

By default there is a user `vpn` with a generated password for portal access. 
The credentials are printed at the end of the deploy script.

If you want to update/add users you can use `vpn-user-portal-account`. 
Provide an existing account to _update_ the password:

    $ sudo -u www-data vpn-user-portal-account --add foo
    Setting password for user "foo"
    Password: 
    Password (repeat): 

You can configure which user(s) is/are an administrator by setting the 
`adminUserIdList` option in `/etc/vpn-user-portal/config.php`, e.g.:

    'adminUserIdList' => ['vpn'],

#### LDAP

It is easy to enable LDAP authentication. This is documented separately. See
[LDAP](LDAP.md).

#### RADIUS

It is easy to enable RADIUS authentication. This is documented separately. See
[RADIUS](RADIUS.md).

**NOTE**: only supported on Debian 11! Will not work on Future releases of 
Debian and/or Ubuntu.

#### SAML

It is easy to enable SAML authentication for identity federations, this is 
documented separately. See [SAML](SAML.md).

### ACLs

If you want to restrict the use of the VPN a bit more than on whether someone
has an account or not, e.g. to limit certain profiles to certain (groups of)
users, see [ACL](ACL.md).

## PHP 

Debian's PHP package has some unfortunate defaults that only work for 
very light usage and in no way for deploys where you expect more than a few 
users to use the service.

Modify `/etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf` (Debian 11) or 
`/etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d/www.conf` (Ubuntu 22.04) and change the following 
settings. We'll use the Fedora defaults here:

    pm = dynamic
    pm.max_children = 50
    pm.start_servers = 5
    pm.min_spare_servers = 5
    pm.max_spare_servers = 35
 
You can tweak those further if needed, but they'll do for some time! Restart 
the PHP service to activate the changes:

    $ sudo systemctl restart php$(/usr/sbin/phpquery -V)-fpm

## Optional

### Web Server Certificates

By default a self-signed certificate is used for the web server. You can 
install your own certificates, and tweak 
`/etc/apache2/sites-available/vpn.example.org.conf` to point to them, or use 
Let's Encrypt using the script mentioned below.

#### Let's Encrypt

Run the script (as root) from the documentation folder:

    $ sudo -s
    # ./lets_encrypt_debian.sh

Make sure you use the exact same DNS name you used when running 
`deploy_debian.sh`! 

After completing the script, the certificate will be installed. It is set to
automatically renew when necessary and gracefully reload Apache after the 
certificate has been replaced.

### Port Sharing

If you also want to allow clients to connect with the VPN over `tcp/443`, see 
[Port Sharing](PORT_SHARING.md).
