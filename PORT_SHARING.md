# Port Sharing

This document describes how to configure your VPN server in such a way as to
make it most likely people can connect to it. This is done by making it 
possible to connect to the VPN service using both `udp/443` and `tcp/443`. A 
complication here is that the web server claims `tcp/443`, so we need to share 
`tcp/443` between the web server and OpenVPN. We'll use 
[sslh](https://github.com/yrutschle/sslh) for this task.

In larger deployments you'll want to use multiple machines where the portal
and API run on a different machine from the OpenVPN backend server(s) so port
sharing is not needed, i.e. OpenVPN can claim `tcp/443` directly.

## VPN

We need to edit `/etc/vpn-server-api/config.php` and modify `vpnProtoPorts` and 
set `exposedVpnProtoPorts`. The `vpnProtoPorts` option includes the protocols 
and ports the OpenVPN processes actually listen on, and `exposedVpnProtoPorts` 
is what the client will get. So here we do not expose `tcp/1194`, but `tcp/443` 
instead:

    'vpnProtoPorts' => [
        'udp/443',
        'tcp/1194',
    ],

    ...

    'exposedVpnProtoPorts' => [
        'udp/443',
        'tcp/443',
    ],

In `vpnProtoPorts` we make OpenVPN listen on `tcp/1194` and NOT on `tcp/443`, 
we need `tcp/443` for sslh to listen on. It will forward connections to 
`tcp/443` to `tcp/1194` internally (or to the web server, depending on what 
makes the request).

You _may_ also want to modify the `range` setting. For 4 OpenVPN processes we
recommend to use a `/24` IP range. For the IPv6 range nothing needs to change 
as the default is a `/64` which is big enough.

If you specify any of the "special" ports, i.e. `udp/443`, `tcp/443`, `udp/53` 
or `tcp/80` they are ALWAYS added to the generated client configuration next
to one "normal" UDP and TCP port. This way, when the connection to the normal 
ports fails, there is a fallback to the special ones which have a higher
chance of working.

## Web Server

### CentOS / Fedora

Modify `/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf` and modify `Listen 443 https` to 
`Listen 8443 https`.

In `/etc/httpd/conf.d/vpn.example.conf`, where `vpn.example` is your actual 
VPN hostname, you modify `<VirtualHost *:443>` to `<VirtualHost *:8443>`.

### Debian

Modify `/etc/apache2/ports.conf` and change the `Listen` lines to `Listen 8443` 
from `Listen 443`.

In `/etc/apache2/sites-available/vpn.example.conf`, where `vpn.example` is your 
actual VPN hostname, you modify `<VirtualHost *:443>` to 
`<VirtualHost *:8443>`.

## Proxy

### CentOS/Fedora

Install sslh:

    $ sudo yum -y install sslh

Configure sslh, we use the following configuration file in `/etc/sslh.cfg`:

    verbose: false;
    foreground: true;
    inetd: false;
    numeric: false;
    transparent: false;
    timeout: 5;
    user: "sslh";
    listen:
    (
        { host: "0.0.0.0"; port: "443"; },
        { host: "::"; port: "443"; }
    );
    protocols:
    (
         { name: "openvpn"; host: "localhost"; port: "1195"; },
         { name: "ssl"; host: "localhost"; port: "8443"; log_level: 0; }
    );

### Debian

Install sslh:

    $ sudo apt -y install sslh

Modify `/etc/default/sslh` by changing `DAEMON_OPTS`:

```
DAEMON_OPTS="--user sslh --listen 0.0.0.0:443 --listen [::]:443 --tls 127.0.0.1:8443 --openvpn 127.0.0.1:1194 --pidfile /var/run/sslh/sslh.pid"
```

## Let's Encrypt

### CentOS/Fedora

If you are using Let's Encrypt with automatic certificate renewal you should 
modify your `/etc/sysconfig/certbot` and set the `PRE_HOOK` and `POST_HOOK` to 
stop/start `sslh` and `httpd`:

```
PRE_HOOK="--pre-hook 'systemctl stop sslh httpd'"
POST_HOOK="--post-hook 'systemctl start sslh httpd'"
```

### Debian

I have no idea how to _properly_ configure certificate renewal on Debian...

## SELinux

On CentOS/Fedora you need to modify SELinux to allow OpenVPN to listen on 
`udp/443`, or any of the other ports you decided to use, e.g.:

    $ sudo semanage port -a -t openvpn_port_t -p udp 443

## Firewall

You need to update the firewall to allow access to `udp/443`. Look 
[here](FIREWALL.md#opening-additional-vpn-ports).

## Applying

### CentOS/Fedora

    $ sudo systemctl restart httpd
    $ sudo systemctl enable --now sslh
	
To apply the configuration changes:

    $ sudo vpn-maint-apply-changes

If the command is not available, install the `vpn-maint-scripts` package first.

### Debian

On Debian, make sure to disable `mod_status`, otherwise `/server-status` will 
be accessible to the whole world. It is enabled by default, and restricted to 
`localhost`, which is exactly where web request appear to be coming from when
using `sslh`.

    $ sudo a2dismod status
    $ sudo systemctl restart apache2
    $ sudo systemctl restart sslh

To apply the configuration changes:

    $ sudo vpn-maint-apply-changes

If the command is not available, install the `vpn-maint-scripts` package first.
