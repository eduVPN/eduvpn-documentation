# Introduction

This document describes version 3 of the API provided by eduVPN and 
Let's Connect! servers.

The API is intended to be used by the eduVPN and Let's Connect! applications.

Using this document you should be able to implement the API in your VPN client, 
or provide the same API for your VPN server to leverage the existing VPN 
clients.

This API is fully supported by all eduVPN / Let's Connect! 3.x servers and 2.x 
servers with version >= 2.4.1.

The API design was finalized and is considered _stable_ from 2022-01-27.

# Standards

We use a simple HTTP API protected by OAuth 2, following all recommendations 
of the [OAuth 2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1/) 
draft specification. See section 10 of that document for a high level overview
of the changes from OAuth 2, it basically boils down:

- Only use "Authorization Code" Grant;
- Use PKCE (RFC 7636);
- Never reuse "refresh tokens";
- Only send the `Bearer` token as part of the HTTP `Authorization` Request 
  Header.

All HTTP request MUST use HTTPS.

# Server Discovery

As there are many servers running eduVPN / Let's Connect! you need to know 
which server you need to connect to. This can be either hard-coded in the 
application, the user can be asked to provide a server address or a "discovery" 
can be implemented.

For eduVPN specific we implement "server discovery" as documented 
[here](SERVER_DISCOVERY.md).

# Server Endpoint Discovery

A "well-known" URL is provided to figure out the OAuth and API endpoint one
has to use. The document can be retrieved from `/.well-known/vpn-user-portal`, 
e.g.:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "http://eduvpn.org/api#3": {
            "api_endpoint": "https://vpn.example.org/vpn-user-portal/api/v3",
            "authorization_endpoint": "https://vpn.example.org/vpn-user-portal/oauth/authorize",
            "token_endpoint": "https://vpn.example.org/vpn-user-portal/oauth/token"
        }
    },
    "v": "3.0.0-1.fc34"
}
```

Servers that provide the `http://eduvpn.org/api#3` key under `api`, support
this API.

This file MUST be freshly retrieved before all attempts to connect to a server 
to make sure any updates to this file are discovered.

## Endpoint Location

When fetching this document, _redirects_, e.g. `301`, `302`, `303`, MUST be 
followed, but MUST NOT allow redirect to anything else than other `https://` 
URLs, e.g. redirects to `http://` MUST be rejected.

# Authorization Endpoint

The `authorization_endpoint` is used to obtain an authorization code through an
"Authorization Request". All query parameters as defined by the OAuth 
specification are required, even optional ones: 

- `client_id`;
- `redirect_uri` MUST be a support URL as found 
  [here](https://git.sr.ht/~fkooman/vpn-user-portal/tree/v3/item/src/OAuth/ClientDb.php), 
  if you need a new registration, please contact us;
- `response_type`: MUST be `code`;
- `scope`: MUST be `config`;
- `state`;
- `code_challenge_method`: MUST be `S256`; 
- `code_challenge`.

Please follow the OAuth specification, or use a library for your platform that
implements OAuth 2.1.

The `authorization_endpoint` with its parameters set MUST be opened in the 
platform's default browser or follow the platform's best practice dealing with
application authorization(s). The `redirect_uri` parameter MUST point back to 
a location the application can intercept.

All error conditions, both during the authorization phase AND when talking 
to the API endpoint MUST be handled according to the OAuth specification(s).

# Token Endpoint

The `token_endpoint` is used to exchange the authorization code, as obtained
through the `redirect_uri` as part of the authorization, for an access and 
refresh token. It is also used to retrieve new access tokens when the current 
access token expires.

All error conditions, both during the authorization phase AND when talking 
to the API endpoint MUST be handled according to the OAuth specification(s).

# Using the API

Every API call below will include a cURL example, and an example response that 
can be expected.

All `POST` requests MUST be sent encoded as 
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

The API can be used with the access token obtained using the OAuth flow as 
documented above. The following API calls are available:

- Get "Info" from the VPN server, including a list of available profiles 
  (`/info`);
- "Connect" to a VPN profile (`/connect`);
- "Disconnect" from a VPN profile (`/disconnect`)

# API Calls

## Info

This call will show the available VPN profiles for this instance. This will 
allow the application to show the user which profiles are available.

This `GET` call has no parameters.

### Request

Request all available VPN profiles:

```bash
$ curl \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer abcdefgh" \
    https://vpn.example.org/vpn-user-portal/api/v3/info
```

### Response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "info": {
        "profile_list": [
            {
                "default_gateway": true,
                "display_name": {
                    "en": "Employees",
                    "nl": "Medewerkers"
                },
                "profile_id": "employees",
                "vpn_proto_list": [
                    "openvpn",
                    "wireguard"
                ]
            },
            {
                "default_gateway": false,
                "display_name": "Administrators",
                "profile_id": "admins",
                "vpn_proto_list": [
                    "wireguard"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The `default_gateway` field indicates whether the client is expected to
route all traffic over the VPN, or only a subset of it. It is either `true` or
`false`.

The `display_name` field can be either of type `string` or `object`. When the
field is an object, the keys are 
[BCP-47 language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag). 

The `vpn_proto_list` field indicates which VPN protocol(s) are supported. If 
a VPN client does not support (some) of the listed protocols, they can be 
omitted, or marked as unsupported in that VPN client. Currently `openvpn` and 
`wireguard` values are supported. As an example: a WireGuard only client 
SHOULD NOT list VPN profiles that only support OpenVPN.

## Connect

Get the profile configuration for the profile you want to connect to.

### Request

Connect to the "Employees" profile (`employees`) and specify a WireGuard public 
key for when WireGuard will be used:

```bash
$ curl \
    -d "profile_id=employees" \
    --data-urlencode "public_key=nmZ5ExqRpLgJV9yWKlaC7KQ7EAN7eRJ4XBz9eHJPmUU=" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer abcdefgh" \
    "https://vpn.example.org/vpn-user-portal/api/v3/connect"
```

**NOTE**: a call to `/connect` immediately invalidates any previously obtained 
VPN configuration files that belong to the same OAuth _authorization_.

The `POST` request has (optional) parameters:

| Parameter    | Required | Value(s)                                                                         |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `profile_id` | Yes      | The `profile_id`, as obtained from the `/info` response                          |
| `public_key` | No       | A WireGuard public key, for the WireGuard protocol                               |
| `prefer_tcp` | No       | Prefer connecting over TCP to the server. Either `yes` or `no`. Defaults to `no` |

If the VPN client supports only WireGuard or OpenVPN and not both, see 
[VPN Protocol Selection](#vpn-protocol-selection) on how to use the `Accept` 
header. To add it to the cURL example use e.g. 
`-H "Accept: application/x-openvpn-profile"` to indicate your client only 
supports OpenVPN.

#### Profile ID

The value of `profile_id` MUST be of one of the identifiers for the profiles 
returned in the `/info` response.

#### Public Key

When the WireGuard protocol is expected to be used, the `public_key` parameter 
MUST be set. The value of `public_key` MUST be a valid WireGuard public key. It 
has this format:

```bash
$ wg genkey | wg pubkey
e4C2dNBB7k/U8KjS+xZdbicbZsqR1BqWIr1l924P3R4=
```

Note for implementation: you MAY use [libsodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/)'s 
`crypto_box_keypair()` to generate a keypair and extract the public key using 
`crypto_box_publickey()` instead of using `exec()` to run the `wg` tool.

**NOTE**: you SHOULD NOT use the same WireGuard private key for different 
servers, generate one *per server*.

**NOTE**: a VPN client MAY opt to generate a new public / private key for 
every new call to `/connect` instead of storing it.

#### Prefer TCP

The `prefer_tcp` parameter is a hint for the VPN server, currently only for the 
OpenVPN protocol.

If set to `yes`, the client indicates that a connection over TCP is preferred.
The server MAY accept this and return an OpenVPN configuration with the TCP 
"remotes" first and thus have the client try to connect over TCP first.

The server MAY ignore the option, for example when the profile only supports
WireGuard, or the OpenVPN server configuration does not use TCP.

### Response

If the profile is an OpenVPN profile you'll get the complete OpenVPN client
configuration with `Content-Type: application/x-openvpn-profile`, e.g.:

```

If the profile is an WireGuard profile you'll get a WireGuard client
configuration with `Content-Type: application/x-wireguard-profile`, e.g.:

```
Expires: Fri, 06 Aug 2021 03:59:59 GMT
Content-Type: application/x-wireguard-profile

[Interface]
Address = 10.43.43.2/24, fd43::2/64
DNS = 9.9.9.9, 2620:fe::fe

[Peer]
PublicKey = iWAHXts9w9fQVEbA5pVriPlAYMwwEPD5XcVCZDZn1AE=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
Endpoint = vpn.example:51820
```

For both OpenVPN and WIreGuard, you MUST use the `Expires` response header 
value to figure out how long the VPN session will be valid for. When 
implementing the client, make sure you never connect to the VPN server with an 
expired VPN configuration.

Before using this configuration, your locally generated private key needs to 
be added under the `[Interface]` section, e.g.:

```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = AJmdZTXhNRwMT1CEvXys2T9SNYnXUG2niJVT4biXaX0=

...
```

## Disconnect

This call is to indicate to the server that the VPN session(s) belonging to 
this OAuth authorization can be terminated. This MUST ONLY be called when the 
_user_ decides to stop the VPN connection.

The purpose of this call is to clean up, i.e. release the IP address reserved
for the client (WireGuard) and delete the certificate from the list of allowed 
certificates (OpenVPN).

After calling this method you MUST NOT use the same configuration again to 
attempt to connect to the VPN server. First call `/connect` again.

This call is "best effort", i.e. it is not a huge deal when the call fails. No 
special care has to be taken when this call fails, e.g. the connection is dead,
or the application crashes. However, it MUST be called on "application exit" 
when the user closes the VPN application without disconnecting first, unless 
the VPN connection can also be persisted outside the VPN application.

This call MUST be executed *after* the VPN connection itself has been 
terminated by the application, if that is possible.

### Request

```bash
$ curl \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer abcdefgh" \
    "https://vpn.example.org/vpn-user-portal/api/v3/disconnect"
```

This `POST` call has no parameters.

### Response

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content

```

## Error Responses

Do **NOT** use the exact "Message" for string comparison in your application 
code, getting any of these (4xx) errors below indicates a problem in the 
application.

Obviously if there in a 5xx error, that is NOT a problem in the client.

| Call          | Example Message                        | Code | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/connect`    | `no such "profile_id"`                 | 404  | When the profile does not exist, or the user has no permission                                |
| `/connect`    | `invalid "prefer_tcp"`                 | 400  | When the specified values are neither `yes` nor `no`                                          |
| `/connect`    | `invalid value for "profile_id"`       | 400  | When the syntax for the `profile_id` is invalid                                               |
| `/connect`    | `missing "public_key" parameter`       | 400  | When the profile only supports WireGuard and no WireGuard public key was provided             |
| `/connect`    | `profile "x" does not support OpenVPN` | 406  | When the profile does not support the VPN protocol(s) supported by the client (or vice versa) | 

An example:

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{"error":"no such \"profile_id\""}
```

In addition to these errors, there can also be an error with the server that we
did not anticipate or is an unusual situation. In that case the response code
will be 500 and the JSON `error` key will contain more information about the
error. This is usually not something the user/client can do anything with and 
it should probably be shown as a "server error" to the user. Possibly with a 
"Try Again" button. The exact error response MUST be logged and accessible by
the user if so instructed by the support desk, and MAY be shown to the user in 
full, however a generic "Server Error" could be considered as well, perhaps 
with a "Details..." button.

# VPN Protocol Selection

The VPN server decides which protocol will be used for the VPN connection. This
can be either OpenVPN or WireGuard. The client _is_ able to influence this 
decision. You don't really need to understand the algorithm, but it will 
explain what is going on when what you see is not what you expect.

The algorithm in the server:

```
Which Protocol Will be Used?
    VPN Client Supports: OpenVPN, but not WireGuard:
        Profile Supports: OpenVPN:
            ---> "OpenVPN"
        ---> Error
        
    VPN Client Supports: WireGuard, but not OpenVPN:
        Profile Supports: WireGuard
            ---> "WireGuard"
        ---> Error
    
    # At this point we know the client supports OpenVPN & WireGuard
     
    Profile Supports: OpenVPN, but not WireGuard:
        ---> "OpenVPN"
        
    Profile Supports: WireGuard, but not OpenVPN:
        ---> "WireGuard"
        
    # At this point we know both the VPN client and Profile supports OpenVPN & WireGuard

    OpenVPN is Preferred Protocol:
        ---> "OpenVPN"
            
    Client Prefers TCP:
        OpenVPN Server Supports TCP:
            ---> "OpenVPN"
        
    Client Provides WireGuard Public Key:
        ---> "WireGuard"
        
    ---> "OpenVPN"
```

A VPN application can indicate protocol support by using the HTTP `Accept` 
request header. This header is used on the `/connect` call.

If the VPN client only supports OpenVPN:

```
Accept: application/x-openvpn-profile
```

If the VPN client only supports WireGuard:

```
Accept: application/x-wireguard-profile
```

If the VPN client supports both OpenVPN and WireGuard:

```
Accept: application/x-openvpn-profile, application/x-wireguard-profile
```

**NOTE**: if the `Accept` request header is missing, it is assumed that the 
VPN client supports both OpenVPN and WireGuard.

# Application Flow

Below we describe how the application MUST interact with the API. It does NOT
include information on how to handle OAuth. The application MUST properly 
handle OAuth, including error cases both during the authorization, when using
a "Refresh Token" and when using the API with an "Access Token".

1. Call `/info` to retrieve a list of available VPN profiles for the user;
2. Show the available profiles to the user if there is >1 profile and allow
   the user to choose. Show "No Profiles Available for your Account" when there
   are no profiles;
3. After the user chose (or there was only 1 profile) perform the `/connect` 
   call as per [Connect](#connect);
4. Store the configuration file from the response. Make note of the value of
   the `Expires` response header to be able to figure out how long your are 
   able to use this VPN configuration;
5. Connect to the VPN;
6. Wait for the user to request to disconnect the VPN...;
7. Disconnect the VPN;
8. Call `/disconnect`;
9. Delete the stored configuration file and its expiry time.

As long as the configuration is not "expired", according to the `Expires` 
response header the same configuration SHOULD be used until the user manually
decides to disconnect. This means that during suspend, or temporary unavailable 
network, the same configuration SHOULD be used. The application SHOULD 
implement "online detection" to be able to figure out whether the VPN allows 
any traffic over it or not.

The basic rules:

1. `/connect` (and `/disconnect`) ONLY need to be called when the user decides 
   to connect/disconnect, not when this happens automatically for whatever 
   reason, e.g. suspending the device, network not available, ...;
2. There are no API calls as long as the VPN is (supposed to be) up (or down).

**NOTE** if the application implements some kind of "auto connect" on 
(device or application) start-up that of course MUST call `/info` and 
`/connect` as well! The `/info` call to be sure the profile is still available 
(for the user) and the `/connect` to obtain a configuration. This does NOT 
apply when the application configures a "system VPN" that also runs without the 
VPN application being active. The application MUST implement a means to notify
the user when the configuration is about to expire.

It can of course happen that the VPN is not working when using the VPN 
configuration that is not yet expired. In that case the client SHOULD inform
the user about this, e.g. through a notification that possibly opens the 
application if not yet open. This allows the user to (manually) 
disconnect/connect again restoring the VPN and possibly renewing the 
authorization when e.g. the authorization was revoked.

# Session Expiry

All VPN sessions have an expiry. The default (as set by the server) is 90 days. 
The server operator is able to change this. Some organizations set the session
expiry as short as 12 hours, others extend it to 3 years. This section 
describes what apps can do to handle session expiry gracefully without 
inconveniencing the user too much.

**NOTE**: the approach described below is a suggestion. However, for the 
official eduVPN/Let's Connect! apps this is a MUST.

The reason for discussing session expiry is that we want to avoid a user's VPN 
connection terminating unexpectedly, e.g. in the middle of a video conference 
call.

In order to help the user avoiding unexpected VPN connection drops, the client
implements:

1. A countdown timer that shows how long the VPN session will still be valid 
   for;
2. A "Renew" button that allows the user to "refresh" the VPN session at a 
   convenient time;
3. An OS notification that informs the user when the expiry is imminent, or has 
   already occurred.

| What                           | Visible                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | 
| Countdown Timer                | Always                                                                   |
| "Renew" Button                 | On the last day*                                                         | 
| OS Notification                | One hour before `${SESSION_EXPIRES_AT}` _AND_ on `${SESSION_EXPIRES_AT}` |

With "On the last day" we mean that each of the following holds: 

1. At least 30 minutes have passed since the _session start_;
2. The _session expiry_ will occur _today_, i.e. within 24 hours;
3. If the total _session duration_ is less than 24 hours, at least 75% of the
   total session duration MUST have passed.
   
Written as an `IF` statement it could be expressed like this:

```
${NOW} > (${SESSION_STARTED_AT} + 30*60)
    && 
${NOW} > (${SESSION_EXPIRES_AT} - 24*60*60)
    && 
${NOW} > (${SESSION_STARTED_AT} + 0.75 * (${SESSION_EXPIRES_AT} - ${SESSION_STARTED_AT}))
```

With `${NOW}` we mean the current time stamp. With `${SESSION_STARTED_AT}` we 
mean the moment the OAuth authorization completed, i.e. the client obtained 
their first OAuth access token. With `${SESSION_EXPIRES_AT}` we mean the time
the session expires, as obtained from the `Expires` HTTP response header 
part of the `/connect` call response.

When the user clicks the "Renew" button the following MUST happen in this 
order:

1. Call `/disconnect`;
2. Delete the OAuth access and refresh token;
3. Start the OAuth authorization flow;
4. Automatically reconnect to the server and profile if (and only if) the 
   client was previously connected.

The OS notification shown to the user _MAY_ offer the "Renew" button inside the
notification as well, if supported by the OS.

| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2021-08-04 | Allow client to specify supported VPN protocols on `/info` call using the `X-Proto-Support` HTTP request header |
| 2021-09-01 | The `vpn_proto` field was added to the `/info` response                                                         |
|            | The `tcp_only` POST parameter was added for OpenVPN profiles                                                    |
|            | The `public_key` POST parameter is now only required for WireGuard profiles                                     |
|            | Remove the `X-Proto-Support` header again now that we have `vpn_proto` in `/info` response                      |
| 2021-09-02 | Add "Error Responses" section                                                                                   |
| 2021-09-20 | Restored the `default_gateway` bool as needed by the NetworkManager client on Linux                             |
| 2021-10-13 | Remove all references to `/info.json`, MUST use `/.well-known/vpn-user-portal` from now on                      |
| 2021-10-27 | Mention following redirects MUST only allow redirecting to `https://`                                           |
| 2021-11-01 | Allow specifying the protocol to use on the `/connect` call                                                     |
|            | The `vpn_proto` field was in the `/info` response and is of type string array                                   |
| 2021-11-02 | Document [VPN Protocol Selection](#vpn-protocol-selection) for clients                                          |
| 2021-11-04 | Update the `/info` response fields, rewrite "VPN Protocol Selection" section                                    |
| 2022-01-05 | The `vpn_proto` POST parameter was removed and `/connect` call simplified, the server will always decide based  |

| 2022-01-06 | The `profile_id` parameter on the `/disconnect` call is never used, no point in having the client send it, so   |
|            | the need to send this has been removed                                                                          |
