# LDAP

This document describes how to configure LDAP. We assume you used the 
`deploy_${DIST}.sh` script to deploy the software.

The LDAP integration can be used both for _authentication_ and _authorization_.

This document talks about _authentication_. See [ACL](ACL.md) for more on 
_authorization_.

## Important Notes

### 3.0.2

There was an issue in `vpn-user-portal` before 3.0.2 where, when 
`userIdAttribute` was set, but not available in the LDAP result set, the user 
provided "User ID" would be used verbatim. This is problematic for two reasons: 

1. If you were using `userFilterTemplate` to restrict access to the service, 
   this didn't actually work. LDAP entries that did NOT match the filter would
   allow the user in with their provided "User ID";
2. If the `userIdAttribute` was NOT available (at all) in the result set due to 
   a mistake in the server configuration, or not all users had that specified
   attribute, the user provided "User ID" would be used verbatim, and *not* the 
   "normalized" value from the LDAP server.

We were not aware that anyone would use the `userFilterTemplate` to restrict
access to the service, as we expect everyone to use [ACL](ACL.md) for doing 
this as documented. There was at least one instance in the wild that did this. 
Potentially there are others.

In case you were depending on this unintended behavior, your VPN server 
installation may fail to allow users to authenticate with version 3.0.2, even 
though it worked with previous versions.

## Introduction

It is a good idea to try with `ldapsearch` if you are not absolutely sure what
to configure. Once `ldapsearch` works, it becomes easier to configure the LDAP
module.

First, install `ldapsearch` and the PHP module for LDAP:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install openldap-clients php-ldap  # Fedora / EL
$ sudo apt install ldap-utils php-ldap        # Debian / Ubuntu
```

Restart PHP to activate the LDAP module:

```
$ sudo systemctl restart php-fpm                            # Fedora / EL
$ sudo systemctl restart php$(/usr/sbin/phpquery -V)-fpm    # Debian / Ubuntu
```
 
You need a couple of details first, you can obtain those from your LDAP 
administrator, you need _at least_:

* LDAP host;
* The attribute to use for user authentication;
* Whether or not this attribute is part of the user's DN.

### FreeIPA

For simple [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page) setups these are
sufficient. Here the `uid` we want to use for users to authenticate is part of 
the DN:

```bash
$ ldapsearch \
    -W \
    -H ldap://ipa.tuxed.example \
    -D "uid=fkooman,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=tuxed,dc=example" \
    -b "uid=fkooman,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=tuxed,dc=example"
```

After providing the user's password, you should see all the LDAP attributes 
associated with that user account, e.g. `memberOf`, `mail`, `uid`.

### Active Directory

If you are using 
[Active Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory), it is 
slightly different, replace `DOMAIN` with the name of your domain and `fkooman` 
with a valid user in your AD:

```bash
$ ldapsearch \
        -W \
        -H ldap://ad.example.org \
        -D "DOMAIN\fkooman" \
        -b "dc=example,dc=org" \
        "(sAMAccountName=fkooman)"
```

You can use the old "NetBIOS domain name" as in the example above, _or_ some 
other 
[options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/6a5891b8-928e-4b75-a4a5-0e3b77eaca52), 
e.g. `userPrincipalName`:

```bash
$ ldapsearch \
        -W \
        -H ldap://ad.example.org \
        -D "fkooman@example.org" \
        -b "dc=example,dc=org" \
        "(userPrincipalName=fkooman@example.org)"
```

### Search First

If you want to use an attribute that is NOT part of the DN, you first need to 
perform a search for the user's DN, based on the attribute + value you 
want. For example we want the users to login with the `uidNumber` attribute and
my `uidNumber` happens to be `572600001`:

For this we do an _anonymous bind_ to figure out my DN in the LDAP:

```bash
$ ldapsearch \
    -LLL \
    -x \
    -H ldap://server.ipa.test \
    -b "cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=ipa,dc=test" \
    "(uidNumber=572600001)" \
    dn
```

This returns my DN, in this case 
`dn: uid=fkooman,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=ipa,dc=test` which we can now use to
bind now to the server to verify the password:

```bash
$ ldapsearch \
    -LLL \
    -W \
    -H ldap://server.ipa.test \
    -D "uid=fkooman,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=ipa,dc=test" \
    -b "uid=fkooman,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=ipa,dc=test"
```

If this works, we can use this information as explained below in the 
configuration examples.

## Configuration

You can configure the portal to use LDAP. This is configured in the file 
`/etc/vpn-user-portal/config.php`.

You have to set `authMethod` first:

```php
'authMethod' => 'LdapAuthModule',
```

Next is configuring the LDAP server in the `LdapAuthModule` section. 

**NOTE**: `{{UID}}` is a special template variable that is replaced by what the 
user specifies in the "User Name" box at login in the portal. If you specify 
`DOMAIN\{{UID}}` as `bindDnTemplate` in the configuration, the actual "bind DN" 
will become `DOMAIN\fkooman` assuming the user entered `fkooman` as 
"User Name" in the portal.

The `userIdAttribute` is used to _normalize_ the user identity. For LDAP both 
`fkooman` and `FKOOMAN` are the same. By querying the `userIdAttribute` we take
the exact same format as used in the LDAP server. This avoids creating multiple
accounts in the VPN service with different case. You SHOULD specify the 
`userIdAttribute`! A future version of the VPN server will make this a MUST.

You can restrict access to the VPN service to a subset of the users in the 
LDAP server by following the [ACL](ACL.md) documentation, or (not recommended) 
by using a filter that only returns results in case the user entry matches a 
specific filter. If you use a filter you MUST specific the `userIdAttribute` as 
the decision whether or not the account is allowed to login is based on whether 
or not results are returned.

```php
'LdapAuthModule' => [
    // *** FreeIPA ***
    // -H ldap://ipa.tuxed.example
    'ldapUri' => 'ldap://ipa.tuxed.example',
    // -D "uid=fkooman,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=tuxed,dc=example"
    'bindDnTemplate' => 'uid={{UID}},cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=tuxed,dc=example',
    // (if -b is the same -D we do NOT specify baseDn...)
    // to normalize the entered user ID, specify the attribute you want to
    // use to identify the user in the VPN server
    'userIdAttribute' => 'uid',

    // *** AD (NetBIOS domain name) ***
    // -H ldap://ad.example.org \
    'ldapUri' => 'ldap://ad.example.org',
    // -D "DOMAIN\fkooman" \
    'bindDnTemplate' => 'DOMAIN\{{UID}}',
    // -b "dc=example,dc=org" \
    'baseDn' => 'dc=example,dc=org',
    // "(sAMAccountName=fkooman)"
    'userFilterTemplate' => '(sAMAccountName={{UID}})',
    // to normalize the entered user ID, specify the attribute you want to
    // use to identify the user in the VPN server
    'userIdAttribute' => 'sAMAccountName',

    // *** AD (userPrincipalName) ***
    // -H ldap://ad.example.org \
    'ldapUri' => 'ldap://ad.example.org',
    // -D "fkooman@example.org" \
    'bindDnTemplate' => '{{UID}}',

    // when the user does NOT specify the realm, e.g. only "fkooman", this
    // option will add "@example.org" to the "User Name" as specified on
    // the login page. If and only if there is no "@" in the provided
    // "User Name".!
    'addRealm' => 'example.org',
    // -b "dc=example,dc=org" \
    'baseDn' => 'dc=example,dc=org',
    // "(userPrincipalName=fkooman@example.org)"
    'userFilterTemplate' => '(userPrincipalName={{UID}})',
    // to normalize the entered user ID, specify the attribute you want to
    // use to identify the user in the VPN server
    'userIdAttribute' => 'userPrincipalName',

    // *** Search First ***
    // -H ldap://server.ipa.test \
    'ldapUri' => 'ldap://server.ipa.test',
    // -b "cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=ipa,dc=test" \
    'baseDn' => 'cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=ipa,dc=test',
    // "(uidNumber=572600001)" \
    'userFilterTemplate' => '(uidNumber={{UID}})',
    // to normalize the entered user ID, specify the attribute you want to
    // use to identify the user in the VPN server
    'userIdAttribute' => 'uidNumber',
    // you can also perform a bind before searching as not all LDAP servers
    // allow anonymous bind to search the directory. If at all possible,
    // allow anonymous bind on your LDAP server from the VPN server.
    // NEVER USE THE LDAP ADMIN ACCOUNT HERE!
    //'searchBindDn' => 'cn=Anonymous Search User,dc=example,dc=org',
    //'searchBindPass' => 's3r3t',

    //'permissionAttributeList' => [],
],
```

This should be all to configure your LDAP!

## LDAPS

In order to use LDAPS, you can use the LDAPS scheme in the `baseUri`
configuration option, e.g.:

```php
'ldapUri' => 'ldaps://ldap.example.org',
```

If you use LDAPS and your LDAP server has a self signed certificate you may
need to make the CA certificate available on the VPN machine.

On the IPA server the CA certificate is stored in `/etc/ipa/ca.crt`. Copy this 
to the machine running the VPN software. If you don't have direct access to the
IPA server you can also use OpenSSL to obtain the CA certificate:

```bash
$ openssl s_client -showcerts -connect ipa.example.org:ldaps
```

You can copy/paste the CA certificate from the certificates shown. 

**NOTE**: make sure you validate this CA out of band! You MUST be sure this 
is the actual CA!

### Fedora / EL

If you use a self signed certificate for your LDAP server perform these steps. 
If your certificate is signed by a trusted CA you do not need to do this, it
will work out of the box.

Put the self signed certificate file in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors`. 
After this:

```bash
$ sudo update-ca-trust
```

This will add the CA certificate  to the system wide database in such a way
that it will remain there, even when the `ca-certificates` package updates.

You **MUST** restart `php-fpm` to pick up the changes:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
```

### Debian / Ubuntu

If you use a self signed certificate for your LDAP server perform these steps. 
If your certificate is signed by a trusted CA you do not need to do this, it
will work out of the box.

Put the self signed certificate file in 
`/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ipa.example.org.crt`. After this:
 
```bash
$ sudo update-ca-certificates
```

This will add the CA certificate  to the system wide database in such a way
that it will remain there, even when the `ca-certificate` package updates.

You **MUST** restart `php-fpm` to pick up the changes:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart php$(/usr/sbin/phpquery -V)-fpm
```

## Troubleshooting

You can use `ldapsearch` to figure out what would be the required values for
the various configuration options and test them independently of the VPN 
service. This is HIGHLY recommended!

In case this turns out to not be enough, additional logging is written to 
_syslog_. You can view the log regarding authentication using `journalctl`, 
i.e.:

```bash
$ sudo journalctl -f -t vpn-user-portal
```

After running this, try to authenticate to the portal and if something goes 
wrong, you'll see it in the log, e.g.:

```
$ sudo journalctl -f -t vpn-user-portal
Jul 26 11:10:46 vpn.example.org vpn-user-portal[150350]: Unable to validate credentials: LDAP error: (49) Invalid credentials
Jul 26 11:11:42 vpn.example.org vpn-user-portal[150726]: Unable to validate credentials: user ID attribute "uidX" not available in LDAP response
```
