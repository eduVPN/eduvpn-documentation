# Introduction

This is the eduVPN/Let's Connect! documentation repository. This repository 
targets administrators and developers. It contains information on how to deploy 
the VPN software, but also (technical) details about the implementation needed 
to (better) integrate it in existing infrastructure, and how to modify the 
software for one's own needs.

**NOTE**: if you are an end-user of eduVPN and want to contact someone, please
contact [eduvpn@surfnet.nl](mailto:eduvpn@surfnet.nl).

We support a release until such time the EOL date has been reached or none of 
the eduVPN servers we officially [support](https://status.eduvpn.org/) are 
running that version anymore, whichever comes first. 

We **only** support the particular release on operating systems that are still 
supported by their vendor!

# Features

This is an (incomplete) list of features of the VPN software:

- OpenVPN server accepting connections on both UDP and TCP ports;
- Uses multiple OpenVPN processes for load sharing purposes;
- Scales from a Raspberry Pi to many core systems with 10GBit networking;
- Full IPv6 support, using IPv6 inside the tunnel and connecting over IPv6;
- Support both NAT and publically routable IP addresses;
- CA for managing client certificates;
- [Secure](SECURITY.md) server and client configuration out of the box;
- User Portal to allow users to manage their configurations for their 
  devices;
- Admin Portal to manage users, configurations and connections;
- Multi Language support in User Portal and Admin Portal;
- Authentication to portals using "static" username and password, 
  [LDAP](LDAP.md), [RADIUS](RADIUS.md) and [SAML](SAML.md);
- OAuth 2.0 [API](API.md) for integration with applications;
- [Two-factor authentication](2FA.md) TOTP and YubiKey support with user 
  self-enrollment for both access to the portal(s) and the VPN;
- [Deployment scenarios](PROFILE_CONFIG.md):
  - Route all traffic over the VPN (for safer Internet usage on untrusted 
    networks);
  - Route only some traffic over the VPN (for access to the organization 
    network);
  - Client-to-client (only) networking;
- Group [ACL](ACL.md) support with SAML and LDAP;
- Ability to disable all OpenVPN logging (default);
- Support multiple deployment scenarios [simultaneously](MULTI_PROFILE.md);
- [SELinux](SELINUX.md) fully enabled;
- [Guest Usage](GUEST_USAGE.md) scenario;
- Native [applications](CLIENT_COMPAT.md) available for most common platforms.
