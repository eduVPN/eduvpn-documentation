# Introduction

This is the eduVPN/Let's Connect! documentation repository. This repository 
targets administrators and developers. It contains information on how to deploy 
the VPN software on a server, but also (technical) details about the 
implementation needed to (better) integrate it in existing infrastructure, and 
how to modify the software for one's own needs.

For more information see:

- https://www.eduvpn.org
- https://letsconnect-vpn.org

**NOTE**: if you are an end-user of eduVPN and want to contact someone, please
try to find the contact information of your organization 
[here](https://status.eduvpn.org/). If you don't know where to go, then simply
contact us at

We support a release until such time the EOL date has been reached or none of 
the eduVPN servers we officially [support](https://status.eduvpn.org/) are 
running that version anymore, whichever comes first. 

We **only** support the particular release on operating systems that are still 
supported by their vendor!

# Features

This is an (incomplete) list of features of the VPN software:

- OpenVPN server accepting connections on both UDP and TCP ports;
- Uses multiple OpenVPN processes for load sharing purposes;
- Scales from a Raspberry Pi to many core systems with 10GBit networking;
- Full IPv6 support, using IPv6 inside the tunnel and connecting over IPv6;
- Support both NAT and publically routable IP addresses;
- CA for managing client certificates;
- Support for [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/);
- [Secure](SECURITY.md) server and client configuration out of the box;
- Portal to allow users to manage their configurations for their 
  devices and admins to manage users, configurations and connections;
- Multi Language support;
- Authentication to portals using local user database (default), 
  [LDAP](LDAP.md), [RADIUS](RADIUS.md), [SAML](SAML.md) and 
  [Client Certificates](CLIENT_CERT_AUTH.md);
- OAuth 2.0 [API](API.md) for integration with native eduVPN/Let's Connect! 
  applications;
- [Deployment scenarios](PROFILE_CONFIG.md):
  - Route all traffic over the VPN (for safer Internet usage on untrusted 
    networks);
  - Route only some traffic over the VPN (for access to the organization 
    network);
  - Client-to-client (only) networking;
- Group [ACL](ACL.md) support with SAML and LDAP;
- Ability to disable all OpenVPN logging (default);
- Support multiple deployment scenarios [simultaneously](MULTI_PROFILE.md);
- [SELinux](SELINUX.md) fully enabled (on Fedora);

# Client Support

See [Client Compatibility](CLIENT_COMPAT.md) for more information about the 
supported VPN clients.

# Deployment

**NOTE**: if you plan to install and run a eduVPN/Let's Connect! server please 
subscribe to the "deployers" mailing list 
[here](https://list.surfnet.nl/mailman/listinfo/eduvpn-deploy). It will be used 
for announcements of updates and discussion about running 
eduVPN/Let's Connect!.

# IRC Contact

You can also join IRC for _technical_ questions/discussions/feedback on 
[Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/), channel `#eduvpn`. Please stick around for 
a while to wait for a response!

You can also easily use the [Web Chat](https://web.libera.chat/#eduvpn) if you 
can't be bothered to setup an IRC client. See you there!

## Supported Operating Systems

- [Debian](DEPLOY_DEBIAN.md) 11 (`x86_64`) 
- [Fedora](DEPLOY_FEDORA.md) 35 (`x86_64`)

**Current Recommendation**: install your VPN server on Debian 11.

Currently we do NOT support CentOS & Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. We are waiting 
for [this](https://pagure.io/epel/issue/75) to be resolved. We avoid using 
third party PHP repositories to prevent having to support these repositories
in the future.

**NOTE**: we expect ALL software updates to be installed and the server 
rebooted before you install the software!

**NOTE**: if you want to deploy on multiple machines for load balancing, please 
follow [these](MULTI_NODE.md) instructions!

## Experimental

- [Fedora](DEPLOY_FEDORA.md) 35 (`aarch64`) 
  (Only available through the "development" repository)

You can use the Fedora `aarch64` packages on e.g. the 
[Raspberry Pi](RASPBERRY_PI.md).

# Development
