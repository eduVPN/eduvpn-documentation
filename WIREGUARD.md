# WireGuard

As WireGuard is new in 3.x, this document will try to dive into some more 
detail regarding how it works.

## Configuration

WireGuard in eduVPN / Let's Connect! has a lot less toggles than OpenVPN so 
should be easier to configure. See the "WireGuard" 
[section](PROFILE_CONFIG.md#wireguard) for more information. There is also the
"global" option to set the WireGuard port. By default this is `51820`.

## Comparison with OpenVPN

There are a number of differences between OpenVPN and WireGuard. Most of them 
are summed up in 
[this](https://www.tuxed.net/fkooman/blog/taming_wireguard.html) blog post.

## What to Use?

It is possible to configure profiles to support both OpenVPN and WireGuard 
simultaneously. We recommend to use WireGuard whenever possible, and only 
provide OpenVPN support for legacy reasons, _or_ when connecting over TCP is a
MUST, for example on broken networks that e.g. block UDP, or have MTU issues.

For most production scenarios we recommend to have the bulk of the users use
WireGuard, but at the same time reserve a little space for OpenVPN connections.

A profile example configuration would look like this:

```php
'ProfileList' => [
    [
        'profileId' => 'office',
        'displayName' => 'Office',
        'hostName' => 'office.vpn.example.org',
        'routeList' => [
            '192.168.1.0/24',
            'fd11::/64',
        ],
        
        // Prefer that VPN clients connect using WireGuard
        'preferredProto' => 'wireguard',
        
        // WireGuard
        'wRangeFour' => '10.42.42.0/24',
        'wRangeSix' => 'fd42:0:0:1::/64',

        // OpenVPN
        'oRangeFour' => '10.42.43.0/25',
        'oRangeSix' => 'fd42:0:0:2::/64',
        
        // do not use OpenVPN with UDP
        'oUdpPortList' => [],
        'oTcpPortList' => [1194],
    ],
],
```
