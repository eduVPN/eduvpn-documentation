# Maintenance

Since 2020-05-05 the package `vpn-maint-scripts` is available in the package
repositories and from this day on will be installed automatically on new 
deployments using the `deploy_${DIST}.sh` scripts. If you deployed before this 
moment, you may need to install the package manually first.

This document is for deploys where only 1 server is involved. For multi node 
maintenance instructions, you can go [here](MULTI_NODE.md#maintenance).

# Install Updates
