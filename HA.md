# High Availability (HA)

The easiest way to install the VPN service is using the `deploy_${DIST}.sh` 
script. This will install the service on a single machine. This work really 
well for most common scenarios. The _availability_ and _reliability_ depend 
directly on that of the system, or virtual machine the service is running on.

By deploying a virtual environment that can has "high availability" (HA) and 
can be scaled (dynamically) this might be more than enough for most 
deployments, even when handling lots of VPN connections. One can handle _a lot_ 
of connections on a system with 64 CPU cores and 10 Gb network. Just saying :-)

Something is to be said for keeping everything on one system or virtual 
machine: it is easy to create a backup/snapshot of the system and restore it 
in a few minutes in case of trouble.

If you do _not_ have a HA virtual cluster at your disposal you may require 
something more, i.e. split the VPN service over multiple systems where you can 
tolerate one or more machines going offline.

Of course, everything has trade-offs. If you are not careful, your service 
could easily become _less_ available, than simply running everything on a 
Raspberry Pi in your office closet ðŸ˜Š

## Terminology

The software conceptually consists of two components that can be "split" and 
which can then run on different (virtual) systems.

1. Portal (also called Controller)
2. Node

The "Portal" handles the Web UI, User Authentication, OAuth API for the VPN 
applications and service configuration.

The "Node" is responsible for configuring the VPN software, i.e. OpenVPN and 
WireGuard, reporting to the Portal and handling the VPN connections themselves.

## Handling More VPN Connections (Multi Node)

If you are not so worried about _availability_, but just want to be able to 
handle more VPN connections than can be offered by a single system, e.g. you 
can't increase the number of CPU cores anymore, reach the network limit, or 
want to "exit" your VPN traffic in different locations, what you are looking 
for is a "Multi Node" setup. This is documented [here](MULTI_NODE.md).

You can add as many nodes as you want to a single Portal. Of 
course, this can also be combined with making the Portal "HA" as explained in 
the next section. **do one first**

For example, the diagram below shows 3 systems, where there are two "Nodes" 
and one Portal:

```
                .----------------.
                | Portal         |
                |                |
                |                |
                |                |
           .--->|                |<---.
           |    |                |    |
           |    .----.           |    |
           |    | DB |           |    |
           |    '----'-----------'    |
           |                          |
           v                          v
.---------------------.    .---------------------.
| Node (1)            |    | Node (2)            |
|                     |    |                     |
|                     |    |                     |
|                     |    |                     |
|                     |    |                     |
|                     |    |                     |
.-----------.---------.    .-----------.---------.
| WireGuard | OpenVPN |    | WireGuard | OpenVPN |
'-----------'---------'    '-----------'---------'
```

When a VPN client attempts to connect, it will pick a "Node" at random, after 
making sure it is "up". So if, for example, one node is down for maintenance, 
the VPN client would simply pick another node and connect to that one.

**NOTE**: the VPN client has to communicate to the Portal in order to determine 
which Node to connect to, this means if one of the nodes goes down, the client
talks again to the Portal to obtain a new configuration file.

## Making the Portal Redundant (HA Portal)

If you _are_ worried about _availability_, you may want to duplicate the Portal 
as well. Obviously, this only makes sense if you have more than one node, 
otherwise there's still a single point of failure (your Node).

Going this way, requires you to have a (network) database available that is 
already "High Available", probably a database cluster. It MUST be more reliable 
than a single Portal system. If you do NOT have this, or are not sure how to 
set this up, duplicating the Portal makes no sense!

Setting up a database cluster is outside of the scope of this documentation, 
we assume you already have one.

Once you decided to go this way, continue reading the documentation 
[here](HA_PORTAL.md).
