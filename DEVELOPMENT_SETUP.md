# Development Setup

This document will describe how to set up an Let's Connect! / eduVPN 
development environment for easy development and running it on your development 
system. 

This is **NOT** meant to be used as installation instructions! See the 
[deploy](README.md#deployment) instructions instead!

We assume you will be using either Fedora >= 37, Debian >= 11 or Ubuntu >= 
22.04. Other distributions MAY also work, but some minor details, regarding 
installation of the required software, will be different.

**NOTE**: if you try to build a package repository you need to be on the 
respective OS: for DEB packages you need to be on Debian, for Fedora/CentOS 
packages you need to be on Fedora.

## Requirements

### Fedora >= 37

If you are not running Fedora as your desktop OS, it is easiest to install a
VM with a desktop. In addition, install the required software (dependencies):

```
$ sudo dnf -y install golang php-cli git composer php-date php-filter php-hash \
    php-json php-mbstring php-pcre php-pdo php-intl php-spl php-sodium php-gmp \
    php-curl php-gd unzip qrencode wireguard-tools scdoc sqlite php-ldap
```

### Debian >= 11, Ubuntu >= 22.04

If you are not running Debian/Ubuntu as your desktop OS, it is easiest to 
install a VM with a desktop. In addition, install the required software 
(dependencies):

```
$ sudo apt install curl git build-essential php-gmp php-sqlite3 composer \
    php-curl php-xml php-gmp php-intl php-cli unzip golang-go qrencode \
    wireguard-tools scdoc sqlite3
```

## Installation

Download the `development_setup_v3.sh` script from this repository and run it. 
It will by default create a directory `${HOME}/Project/eduVPN-v3` under which 
everything will be installed. No `root` is required!

```bash
$ curl -L -O https://codeberg.org/eduVPN/documentation/raw/branch/v3/development_setup.sh
$ sh ./development_setup.sh
```

**NOTE**: running this command can take a long time, this has to do with Go
dependency downloads (almost 1GB) to `$(HOME}/go` for some reason ðŸ¤·.

## Testing

All projects have unit tests included, they can be run from the project folder,
e.g.: 

    $ cd ${HOME}/Projects/eduVPN-v3/vpn-user-portal
    $ make test

## Using

A "launch" script is included to run the PHP built-in web server to be able
to easily test the portals.

    $ cd ${HOME}/Projects/eduVPN-v3
    $ sh ./launch.sh

Now with your browser you can connect to the user portal on 
`http://localhost:8082/`.

You can login with the users `foo` with password `bar` (user account) or `admin`
with password `secret` (administrator account).

## VPN Server Configuration

To generate the OpenVPN server configuration files:

    $ cd ${HOME}/Projects/eduVPN-v3/vpn-server-node
    $ php libexec/server-config.php

The OpenVPN server configuration files will be written to `openvpn-config`, the
WireGuard configuration files will be written to `wg-config`.

### OpenVPN 

Unfortunately it is not that easy to start OpenVPN server processes on your 
development machine as it requires certain "libexec" scripts to be in the 
right location. It should be possible to do this with symlinks, but that is 
left as an exercise to the reader. It is typically not necessary to have real
OpenVPN processes running on your development system.

To start: you can copy `openvpn-config/*` to `/etc/openvpn/server` and start 
OpenVPN, e.g.:

```
$ sudo systemctl start openvpn-server@default-{0,1}
```

### WireGuard

You can copy `wg-config/wg0.conf` to `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` and start 
WireGuard using this configuration file. 

```
$ sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
```

This will allow `vpn-daemon` to 
interact with WireGuard on your development machine.

**NOTE**: in order for `vpn-daemon` to interact with your local WireGuard 
setup it needs to have the right capabilities, i.e. `CAP_NET_ADMIN`. The 
easiest is to (re)start vpn-daemon as `root`, or use the `vpn-daemon.service` 
file as can be found 
[here](https://git.sr.ht/~fkooman/vpn-daemon#systemd), but make sure to update 
the path at `ExecStart=`.

## Development

### Composer

We'll depend on a number of packages for development purposes that you can
install first.

```
$ mkdir -p ${HOME}/.composer`
$ cat << EOF > ${HOME}/.composer/composer.json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://git.sr.ht/~fkooman/put"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "fkooman/put": "^0",
        "friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer": "^3",
        "phploc/phploc": "^7",
        "phpstan/phpstan": "^1",
        "vimeo/psalm": "^5",
        "phan/phan": "^5",
        "phpmd/phpmd": "^2",
        "phpbench/phpbench": "^1"
    }
}
EOF
$ composer global update
```

On macOS you need to add `${HOME}/.composer/bin` to your `PATH`, e.g.:

```
$ echo '/Users/fkooman/.composer/vendor/bin' | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/composer
```

Don't forget to close all terminals. On Fedora this is not necessary, it will 
be automatically added to your path, but does require a logout/login after
installing the `composer` package.

The tools `php-cs-fixer`, `phploc`, `phpstan` and `psalm` are used during
development. You can read about their purpose on their respective websites:

* [php-cs-fixer](https://cs.symfony.com/)
* [psalm](https://psalm.dev/)
* [phpstan](https://phpstan.org/)
* [phploc](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phploc)

The VPN software (and dependencies) contain `Makefile` targets that use this 
software.

## Modifying Code

If you want to modify any of your code, it makes sense to switch to using your
own "fork". We'll only consider the eduVPN/LC components here and not the 
underlying dependencies.

For example if you want to modify `vpn-user-portal` you can do the following, 
we assume you already have an empty `vpn-user-portal` repository created on 
GitHub:

```
$ mkdir ${HOME}/tmp && cd ${HOME}/tmp
$ git clone --bare https://git.sr.ht/~fkooman/vpn-user-portal
$ cd vpn-user-portal
$ git push --mirror git@github.com/fkooman/vpn-user-portal
```

You can add GitHub as a remote now to your project checkout of 
`vpn-user-portal`:

```
$ cd ${HOME}/Projects/eduVPN-v3/vpn-user-portal
$ git remote add github git@github.com/fkooman/vpn-user-portal
```

Now when you make changes to the code you can push them to your own repository
"fork"

```
$ git branch my-feature-branch
$ git checkout my-feature-branch
...
$ git commit -a -m 'implement feature X'
$ git push github my-feature-branch
```

If this works properly locally, you can send a "pull request" or 
"merge request" to the upstream project, or even create a package repository
containing your own version of `vpn-user-portal` if necessary! 

When working with RPM packages for CentOS/Fedora you can easily create a 
package from a commit. For DEB packages you need to make a release first. What
I am doing is developing on CentOS/Fedora and only when considered stable I'll
make a release after which I also create Debian packages.

## Creating RPM packages

First install all requirements on your Fedora system as described 
[here](https://git.sr.ht/~fkooman/builder.rpm).

So we assume you have your own fork of `vpn-user-portal` as shown above. Now 
how to create an RPM package for it in your own development repository?

The `vpn-user-portal` package also has an RPM package repository, we assume you 
already have an empty `vpn-user-portal.rpm` repository created on GitHub::

```
$ mkdir ${HOME}/tmp && cd ${HOME}/tmp
$ git clone --bare https://git.sr.ht/~fkooman/vpn-user-portal.rpm
$ cd vpn-user-portal.rpm
$ git push --mirror git@github.com/fkooman/vpn-user-portal.rpm
```

Add the new remote to `rpm/vpn-user-portal.rpm`:

```
$ cd ${HOME}/Projects/eduVPN-v3/rpm/vpn-user-portal.rpm
$ git remote add github git@github.com/fkooman/vpn-user-portal.rpm
```

Now you can modify the SPEC file under 
`vpn-user-portal.rpm/SPECS/vpn-user-portal.spec` to point to your Git 
repository and commit. 

Modify the following lines, point `%global git` to your Git commit:

```
%global git 925933279f8f4b99e242d4c154be7c6c55aa91e6

Version:    2.4.8
Release:    0.1%{?dist}

...

Source0: https://github.com/fkooman/vpn-user-portal/archive/%{git}.tar.gz

...

%changelog
* Tue Feb 09 2021 FranÃ§ois Kooman <fkooman@tuxed.net> - 2.4.8-0.1
- update to development package
```

Set `Version` to one higher than the current version.
The `0.1` in the `Release` field indicates it is a pre-release version. Also 
update the `%changelog` entry.

You can try to build this package locally:

```
$ rpmdev-setuptree
$ cd ${HOME}/Projects/eduVPN-v3/rpm/vpn-user-portal.rpm
$ spectool -g -R SPECS/vpn-user-portal.spec
$ cp SOURCES/* ${HOME}/rpmbuild/SOURCES
$ rpmbuild -bs SPECS/vpn-user-portal.spec
$ rpmbuild -bb SPECS/vpn-user-portal.spec
```

Or use the `${HOME}/.local/bin/local_build` script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if [ -d SPECS ]; then
    # we are in the package root
    spectool -g -R SPECS/*.spec
    cp SOURCES/* "${HOME}/rpmbuild/SOURCES"
    rpmbuild -bs SPECS/*.spec
    rpmbuild -bb SPECS/*.spec    
elif [ -d ../SPECS ]; then
    # we are in the SPECS directory already
    spectool -g -R ./*.spec
    cp ../SOURCES/* "${HOME}/rpmbuild/SOURCES"
    rpmbuild -bs ./*.spec
    rpmbuild -bb ./*.spec    
else 
    echo "ERROR: cannot find SPEC file"
    exit 1
fi
```

Then you can commit your changes:

```
$ git commit -a -m 'update to development package'
$ git push github
```

Once this is complete, you can continue and create your own package repository 
by following the instructions [here](https://git.sr.ht/~fkooman/builder.rpm). 
Make sure you update `REPO_URL_BRANCH_LIST` and point it to your fork of the 
`vpn-user-portal.rpm` package.

If all goes well, you'll end up with your own RPM repository with your fork
of the package in it!

## Software Releases

The following script is used to make official releases of the components as 
`tar.xz`. It signs the source code with both PGP (for the Debian packages) and
with [Minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) for Fedora/CentOS. 
Please setup your own PGP and Minisign keys before running this script.

Make sure your `${HOME}/.gitconfig` contains at least the following:

```
[user]
	name = FranÃ§ois Kooman
	email = fkooman@deic.dk

[tar "tar.xz"]
	command = xz -c
```

Add the following to the file `${HOME}/.local/bin/make_release`:

```
#!/bin/sh
PROJECT_NAME=$(basename "${PWD}")
PROJECT_VERSION=${1}
RELEASE_DIR="${PWD}/release"
KEY_ID=6237BAF1418A907DAA98EAA79C5EDD645A571EB2

if [ -z "${1}" ]; then
    # we take the last "tag" of the Git repository as version
    PROJECT_VERSION=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
    echo Version: "${PROJECT_VERSION}"
fi

mkdir -p "${RELEASE_DIR}"
if [ -f "${RELEASE_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}-${PROJECT_VERSION}.tar.xz" ]; then
    echo "Version ${PROJECT_VERSION} already has a release!"
    exit 1
fi

git archive --prefix "${PROJECT_NAME}-${PROJECT_VERSION}/" "${PROJECT_VERSION}" -o "${RELEASE_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}-${PROJECT_VERSION}.tar.xz"
gpg2 --default-key ${KEY_ID} --armor --detach-sign "${RELEASE_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}-${PROJECT_VERSION}.tar.xz"
minisign -Sm "${RELEASE_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}-${PROJECT_VERSION}.tar.xz"
```

Modify the `KEY_ID` variable to point to your own PGP key. Make the script 
executable:

    $ chmod +x ${HOME}/.local/bin/make_release

### SourceHut

In order to upload the release, I'm using the `sr.ht` API. I am storing this
file under `${HOME}/.local/bin/sr.ht_upload_release`. You'll need to update the
locations. For other source hosting platforms it will be different.

Make sure you have `curl` installed.

Make sure you store your API key under `${HOME}/.config/sr.ht/api.key`, 
do not add any trailing new lines, e.g.:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ${HOME}/.config/sr.ht
$ echo -n 'raw-key-string' > ${HOME}/.config/sr.ht/api.key
```

The script:

```
#!/bin/sh
#POST /api/:username/repos/:name/artifacts/:ref
#
#Attaches a file artifact to the specified ref.
#
#Note: this endpoint does not accept JSON. Submit your request as multipart/form-data, with a single field: "file".

V=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
B=$(cat ${HOME}/.config/sr.ht/api.key)
R=$(basename $(pwd))

for F in release/*${V}*; do
	curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${B}" -F "file=@${F}" "https://git.sr.ht/api/~fkooman/repos/${R}/artifacts/${V}"
done
```

### Codeberg

In order to upload the release, I'm using the `codeberg.org` API. I am storing 
this file under `${HOME}/.local/bin/codeberg.org_upload_release`. You'll need 
to update the locations. For other source hosting platforms it will be 
different.

Make sure you have `curl` and `jq` installed.

You can create a new API key 
[here](https://codeberg.org/user/settings/applications). Make sure you give
it "Read and Write" permissions in the "repository" category.

Make sure you store your API key under `${HOME}/.config/codeberg.org/api.key`, 
do not add any trailing new lines, e.g.:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ${HOME}/.config/codeberg.org
$ echo -n 'raw-key-string' > ${HOME}/.config/codeberg.org/api.key
```

The script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# create release
# @see https://codeberg.org/api/swagger#/repository/repoCreateRelease

# upload artifact
# @see https://codeberg.org/api/swagger#/repository/repoCreateReleaseAttachment

ORG=eduVPN
V=$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags)
B=$(cat ${HOME}/.config/codeberg.org/api.key)
R=$(basename $(pwd))

JSON_BODY="{\"tag_name\": \"${V}\"}"

# create the release
RELEASE_ID=$(curl -s \
    -H "Authorization: token ${B}" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "${JSON_BODY}" \
    https://codeberg.org/api/v1/repos/${ORG}/${R}/releases | jq -r .id)

# upload the artifact(s)
for F in release/*${V}*; do
    curl \
        -s \
        -X "POST" \
        -H "Authorization: token ${B}" \
        -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
        -F "attachment=@${F}" \
        "https://codeberg.org/api/v1/repos/${ORG}/${R}/releases/${RELEASE_ID}/assets"
done
```

## Creating DEB packages

Debian packages currently only work from proper releases. Updating the Debian 
packages is described [here](https://git.sr.ht/~fkooman/nbuilder.deb). You can
also use your own `vpn-user-portal.deb` fork to get going. Follow the 
instructions there.
