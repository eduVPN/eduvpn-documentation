# Multi Profile Node

As shown in the [Multi Profile](MULTI_PROFILE.md) and 
[Multi Node](MULTI_NODE.md) documentation it is possible to define multiple 
profiles, and run those profiles on multiple nodes.

We updated [Multi Node](MULTI_NODE.md) to also include the scenario where 
you have multiple profiles, so this document is obsolete.
